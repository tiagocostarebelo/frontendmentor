## My process

First I started by rewritting the HTML, creating the necessary elements to hold everything.
After that, in mobile screen size, I styled everything.
To finalize, I switched to desktop size (1440px above).
This time, I've included CSS Resets that I haven't in the previous solutions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was mostly a "remember" the basics of using Grid, but it was nice to use it again for a simple solution as this one.
Will definitely try to use it more. Along with Flexbox it makes life easier when creating layouts.

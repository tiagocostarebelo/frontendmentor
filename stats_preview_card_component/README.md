## My process

First I started by rewritting the HTML, creating the necessary elements to hold everything.
After that, in mobile screen size, I styled everything.
To finalize, I switched to desktop size (1440px above).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Once again, positioning, centering and this time playing with the image to fit it in place (which still got me to keep learning more after this challenge).

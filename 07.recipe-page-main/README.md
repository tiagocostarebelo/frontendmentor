## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS BEM naming convention

### What I learned

Took this chance to review some basic fundamentals of HTML structure and semantic elements and  and CSS, reinforce my usage of the BEM naming convention.

### Useful resources

- [Border in tables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20872200/giving-a-border-to-an-html-table-row-tr) - Usefull thread in StackOverflow on how to add border to table rows. I forgot we needed to add "border-collapse: collapse" to our table, so we can then use the border attribute to our rows.
- ["Contains" Attribute selector](https://www.impressivewebs.com/css3-attribute-selectors-substring-matching/) - I had learnt about this selector while doing Codecademy, and it's very useful to target elements that contain a specific string in their attribute value.

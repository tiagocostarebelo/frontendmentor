## My process

First I started by rewritting the HTML, creating the necessary elements to hold everything.
After that, in mobile screen size, I styled everything.
To finalize, I switched to desktop size (1440px above).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was challenging to get through the background and the position of the two opposite circular shapes.
I tried a few approaches but as they weren't working, I googled and I ended up in the W3Schools link bellow. It showed me that one of my initial solutions was half right. All i needed was get the background-position values right.
I was struggling, as I was only using the suggestions that linked was giving, like bottom right, top left but they were not working. 
So I went and googled if I could use different values to style the background-position. As I went for the answers, I ended up finding the MDN for that property and I reached this solution.
